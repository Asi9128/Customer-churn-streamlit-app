Customer Prediction App
This is a Streamlit-based web application designed to predict customer behaviors or outcomes using machine learning models. The app provides an intuitive interface for users to explore data, make predictions, and gain insights.

Features
User-friendly interface powered by Streamlit.
Supports multiple machine learning models:
Decision Tree
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
XGBoost

Enables users to upload data and view predictions.
Provides interactive data visualizations and dashboards.


Use the app to:

Upload customer data.
Select a machine learning model.
View predictions and insights.
